# MTB Connect
The goal of MTB Connect is to make it easier for mountain bikers to find new trails to ride and new friends to ride them with! Search for trails by zip-code, view the descriptions of different trails, and see whose ridden those trails recently so you can send them friend requests to connect for the next mountain bike adventure!
